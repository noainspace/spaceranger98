Regard 3d

Here is a chart showing the progress I went through when trying the various setting combinations. In order to continue to form the dense point cloud which can take hours to make there must be atlas 90% of the cameras found. Cameras refers to pictures that can be used to form the match and the number of cameras is number of pictures within the set. 

Picture set 1

Matche0: default setting 
Conclusion: glare created distortion. New photo set with softer light.

Picture set 2
Matche0: Sensitivity: minimal 
	    Kmr: ultra
	    Kd: classical A-KAZE
	    Matching algorithm: FLANN
 	    Camera Model: pinhole
Runtime  50 min and it looks bad 

Triangulation0: 
Global default settings results
 Cameras: 128/130
Number of points: 14492
Runt time 47 min
Conclusion: unable to continue to form  dense point cloud

Match1: key point sensitivity: normal
		Kew point matching ratio: high
		Camera model: pinhole browser 2
		Matching algorithm: KgraphPrecise
		Key point detector: Classical A-KAZE
runtime 9hrs 57min

Triangulation1:

ERROR


Picture set 3

Match0: key point sensitivity: normal
		Kew point matching ratio: high
		Camera model: pinhole
		Matching algorithm: FLANN
		Key point detector: Classical A-KAZE
Runtime 5 min 18 sec

Match1: key point sensitivity: min
		Kew point matching ratio: ultra
		Camera model: pinhole
		Matching algorithm: KgraphFast
		Key point detector: Classical A-KAZE
Runtime 4min 21 sec

Triangulation: 
Default setting results
Cameras: 3/19
Number of points: 577

Conclusion: unable to continue to form  dense point cloud


Picture set 4

Match0: default settings 
Run time: 7 min 45 sec

Triangulation 0-5:
Incremental= error 
Note: incremental does not work at all for me only the global settings

0. Global. L2. Softl1. = 13/36 cameras, 4142 points
1.Global. L2. L2. = 13/36 cameras, 4142 points
2.Global. L2. L1.= 13/36 cameras, 4142 points
3.Global. L1. Softl1= 13/36 cameras, 4142 points
4.Global. L1. L2.= 13/36 cameras, 4142 points
5.Global. L1. L2.= 13/36 cameras, 4142 points

Conclusion: unable to continue to form  dense point cloud

Matches1: key point sensitivity: normal
		Kew point matching ratio: normal
		Camera model: pinhole
		Matching algorithm:FLANN
		Key point detector: Classical A-KAZE
Runtime 7min 46 sec

Triangulation 0-2:

0.Global. L2. Softl1. = 14/36 cameras, 4227 points
1.Global. L2. L2. = 14/36 cameras, 4227 points
2.Global. L2. L1. = 14/36 cameras, 4227 points

Conclusion: triangulation does not have a significant effect, unable to continue to form  dense point cloud

Matche2: key point sensitivity: normal
		Kew point matching ratio: higher
		Camera model: pinhole
		Matching algorithm:FLANN
		Key point detector: Classical A-KAZE
Runtime 7min 14sec

Triangulation0:
Global. L2. Softl1. = 21/36 cameras, 7552 points

Conclusion: does not form a significant enough spare cloud point

Match3: key point sensitivity: normal
		Kew point matching ratio: higher
		Camera model: pinhole
		Matching algorithm:FLANN
		Key point detector: Classical A-KAZE
Runtime 7 min 57 sec
 


Photoshoot 

This is a record of the camera settings and whatever editing that was done to the photos before they were put into regard3d. Regarding matters such as light please refer to the diagrams found in my open note book here.

Picture set 1.
Camera mode: no flash, RAW processing 
Edits made: none
Cameras: 45
Errors found: light is to harsh, to much glare, software unable to match close ups.
Conclusion: soften the lighting, take more pictures on several angels, no close ups.

Picture set 2.
Camera mode: action, RAW processing 
Edits made: none
Cameras: 131
Errors found: the environment created to much noise, glare distortion, takes an average of 5 hours to process matches and 8+ hours to process triangulation.
Conclusion: fix the glare and find a way to improve the point triangulation, get rid of any background environment.

Picture set 3.
Camera more: portrait, RAWfine
Edits made: enhanced in Photos, reduced brightness, covered the tool box in dots before taking photos
Cameras: 19 
Errors found: the focal point changed making almost 50% of the photos useless, still has glare, the fabric created noise, not enough photos.
Conclusion: get rid of the glare, no background, more soft light.

Picture set 4.
Camera mode: no flash, RAWfine, used the timer 
Edits: enhanced in Photos, dots on the box before taking photos, dusted with powder.
Camera: 39
Errors: same errors, only 1 surface generated. 
Conclusion: failure
