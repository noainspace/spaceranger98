About the Object

The object I’ve chosen to do is a red tool box that I bought from an antique store. I was looking for a box to put all of my frequently used paints and brushes in when I saw it. The box itself has a lot of personality put into it by its previous owner and in a way, by history. The box has stickers plastered all over it. Rock bands, and social movements from when my parents were teenagers are on these stickers. It evokes a sense of nostalgia in a way. By looking at the box I can already tell so you so many things; This person cares about the environment, they like old rock music, they take care of their things, they have a strong sense of politics, they’re vegan, they’re creative. Even the time period in which they were in by the how old the bands are, or where they live based on the sticker that says ‘I break for penguins’. Just as a work of art this object had a presence. 

I think that recreating this object has a lot of benefits that could counter the mass production of duplicated objects that seem to feed capitalism. Small businesses can scan their creations and then use that to create 3d printable objects. These businesses can now create things at a faster pace allowing them to sell more products and compete with larger companies. The more sales they have will also make the prices go down on their products which is another way to attract more customers and compete with larger brands prices. I also think that is has a lot of value just as a piece of history. It is a representation of youth culture from the past, and it can be used to compare and contrast youth today. This is because the things that you surround yourself with and the things you value says a lot about you. What people define as precious changes throughout the generations, and it can tell you a lot about how society changes.
