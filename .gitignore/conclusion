Conclusion 

“I come back to a mess”


Merit in failure:
Did I accomplish anything I set out to do? Absolutely not. The final objects I got were distorted and ugly. I accomplished getting 2 side of the box to work together and that is it. I don’t know where I went wrong but I suppose I will have to find out for the next module. Looking on the brighter side of things even if I did bomb this assignment my work here seems to embody the meaning of ‘trial and error’. As someone  who came into this with no knowledge of coding or computer science stuff I have learned a lot. I have a basic understanding of some of these technical terms, and regard3d which has widened my skill set.  I have a better understanding of the digital humanities and what it is (frustration and science). Even though I am taking these results as a loss, I think I won at a few things.
