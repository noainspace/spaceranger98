Authors note

When I set out to do this project I had one thing that I wanted to do. I wanted to create art. Of course I still wanted to do what the course was asking me to do which was to make a copy of an object but being who I am how I viewed this project was through and artistic lens. I, of course had a lot of conflicting thoughts throughout the process. I expressed them briefly in my open notebook on Github but they were deleted some how. I kept physical notes during the actual experimentation phase of the project so I was able to still give an accurate and honest time line of events but none of my thoughts about the core concepts and my own ideology during the initial researching phase. So Iâ€™ve decided to put them in the intro and the conclusion.
